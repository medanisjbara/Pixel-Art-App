# Pixel Art App
This python program is made to emulate a pixel art android phone. It is intended to be used in [pydroid3](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.iiec.pydroid3&gl=US) on android phones, other usages might be possible as well.

## Installation
Since pydroid comes with pygame, and since pygame is the only requirement (for now, check [Requirements](#requirement)), which comes preinstalled on pydroid3, you only need to have pydroid3 app installed on your phone.

## Requirements
For now, the only requirement is pygame, although numpy will be needed in the future since it is crucial for some functionalities that will be added in the future.

## To-do
* Make use of auto screen scaling in pygame (so that the code is independent from resolution)
* Fix "bucket fill" functionality.
* Make better documentation.
